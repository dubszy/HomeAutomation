# Home Automation

## Abstract
This project is a work in progress that attempts to explore the possibilities of home automation.

## Scope
Currently, this project is a custom implementation of home automation. It makes use of the Raspberry Pi, Arduino, and
various sensors and does not include support for any type of smart home retail products. Support for such products may
be included in the future, but that is not within the current scope of this project.
